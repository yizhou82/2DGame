# 2D Game
I implemented a 2D horror escape game in java.

I used java to program this game to improve my java programming skills, in addition to gaining experience in gaming development.


Through my journey of developing this game, I encountered many challenges since I was relatively new to programming with user interfaces and
interacting with JFrame. A few challenges included adding player collisions and animating the player and objects in the game.

Finding some guide on the internet, I was able to produce a small game which utilized the java abstract window toolkit and 
many other utilities. In the future, I plan to update and further develop this game, such as making enemy entities move and follow the player. 

# Lore

You are tiny green orb in the middle of an abandonded area. Just by looking at the bright green color of yourself, you realize this place is not only a strange house but also this place is located in a different realm. Suddenly, a shiny purple portal opened somewhere in this creepy place. Without thinking about where this portal could lead to, you decided to find a way to it anyway. In this place, there are creepy eyes looking into you from the abyss and some... strange... figures..? They are lingering around the area with a kind but haunting demeanor.

# How to play

Open the code in an IDE and run the main method.

Find the portal and enter it to escape this place.

Use WASD keys to move around. Hold shift to sprint.

Can you beat my personal best (18.88s)?
